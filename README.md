Using DHT22 sensor with Arduino Uno

This is just a basic use of the Adafruit [DHT sensor library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library). I wanted to connect my [freetronics DHT22 sensor](http://www.freetronics.com.au/products/humidity-and-temperature-sensor-module#.VPULH_nQq-0) to 
my [sparkfun red board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12757) and get some output on the serial line. The idea is to take this code and look to
use this on the sparkcore.
